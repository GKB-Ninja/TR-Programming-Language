<h2>🔤 Custom Syntax Analyzer with Turkish Literal Support</h2>

This project is a lexical analyzer for a simple custom programming language, with specialized support for Turkish characters in identifiers and keywords. Written in C, it tokenizes arithmetic expressions, control flow statements (if, for, while, etc.), and includes extended logic to handle Turkish-specific Unicode characters.
